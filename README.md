# employee_directory

## Description


This project was built so that a business owner could view data about departments, roles, and employees within their company. This command-line application accepts users input, and allows a user to view their department, employees, and employees roles and presents them with a table that is formatted from their input. It also allows a user to update and add employees as well as add different employee roles and departments. It uses the inquirer package with MySql2 to connect to MySql, and console.table to print the tables. While my app isnt fully functioning appropriately just yet, I was able to get the command line application up and running with inquirer and MySql. 

## Installation

You must install inquirer and MySql2 to begin your command line application. After, you can run npm start to begin the application. Enter control C at anytime to quit.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
